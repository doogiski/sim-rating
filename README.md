# sim-rating
This repo contains two folders. 

One folder holds the yearly Jupyter notebook files that hold the models for SIM Ratings. Every year, there will be an updated folder with the new notebooks as the model will be tweaked every year.

The other folder holds all the scripts used to pull data from NHL.com's API and scrape a bit of data from Elite Prospects.
